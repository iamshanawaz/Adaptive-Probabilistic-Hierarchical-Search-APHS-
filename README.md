Adaptive Probabilistic Hierarchical Search (APHS): A Novel Framework for Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Optimization

Abstract
Dynamic heterogeneous graphs are ubiquitous in real-world applications, from logistics and fraud detection to social network analysis. However, existing graph algorithms often struggle to balance efficiency, adaptivity, and scalability in such complex environments. This paper introduces Adaptive Probabilistic Hierarchical Search (APHS), a novel framework that combines dynamic programming principles, graph neural networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize graph-based tasks. APHS dynamically decomposes graphs into context-aware subgraphs, employs RL-guided prioritization for efficient exploration, and integrates time-decay functions to handle temporal dynamics. We evaluate APHS on benchmark datasets and real-world applications, demonstrating superior performance in tasks like route optimization and fraud detection compared to state-of-the-art methods like HiBO and AHLCSA. Our results highlight APHS’s potential to revolutionize graph-based optimization in dynamic, heterogeneous environments.

1. Introduction
Graphs are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems, but their dynamic and heterogeneous nature poses significant challenges for traditional algorithms. For example:
Logistics: Real-time route optimization must adapt to changing traffic conditions.
Fraud Detection: Financial transaction graphs evolve rapidly, requiring incremental updates.
Social Networks: User interactions are multi-relational (e.g., friendships, comments) and time-sensitive.
Existing approaches, such as hierarchical Bayesian optimization (HiBO) and adaptive heuristic search algorithms (AHLCSA), are limited in their ability to handle these complexities. To address this gap, we propose APHS, a framework that:
Dynamically decomposes graphs into overlapping subproblems using GNN-based clustering.
Guides exploration with RL-driven probabilistic prioritization.
Handles temporal dynamics through time-decay functions.

2.1 Graph Algorithms
Hierarchical Search: Methods like Dijkstra’s and A* are efficient but lack adaptivity for dynamic graphs.
Graph Neural Networks: GNNs (e.g., GraphSAGE, GAT) excel at node representation but struggle with temporal and heterogeneous data.
2.2 Optimization Algorithms
HiBO: Focuses on black-box optimization but is not designed for graph-structured data.
AHLCSA: Uses swarm intelligence for combinatorial optimization but lacks mechanisms for dynamic environments.
2.3 Reinforcement Learning in Graphs
RL has been applied to graph traversal (e.g., DeepPath) but not in conjunction with hierarchical decomposition and temporal adaptivity.
